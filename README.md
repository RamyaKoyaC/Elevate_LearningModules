### There is something called Lint issues while trying to run code for front end and so we will be doing 
``` 
ng lint 
``` 

to spot those issues. Once we do that command, all the files with the lint issues will be shown on the terminal console and do a Ctrl+click to go to that particular file. 

Once you reach the file, click on the area which is underlined and do a right click and click on Source Action. You will see that there is TSLint Fix option, click on it and it will take care of the rest.
